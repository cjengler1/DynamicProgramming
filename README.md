# DynamicProgramming

Presented is a python implementation of a gridworld reinforcement learning agent. The implementation  follows directly from my paper on Dynamic Programming found at https://github.com/cjengler1/Current-Research/blob/master/Dynamic%20Programming.pdf. 

This implementation is in python 3.4 or newer. The requirements for this implementation are given in the requirements.txt file. 

This implementation utilizes and extension of the OpenAI Gym Gridworld environment, found in the gridworld.py file.

To run this implementation as is, clone this repository, enter the cloned directory and type the following from a command prompt:

python dynamicprogramming.py
